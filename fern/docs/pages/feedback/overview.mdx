Users and Agents can provide feedback on Maven's responses. 
Feedback is automatically submitted when a user clicks thumbs up or thumbs down. Users can optionally provide 
feedback text. Feedback is also created when a user sees a handoff response from Maven or when a human agent clicks 
the insert button within Copilot.

Note that thumbs up and thumbs down feedback are used as part of Maven's 
[quality calculations](https://mavenagi.com/glossary#quality).

## Navigation

- **Feedback**: The Feedback page displays all feedback received by Maven. Feedback can be filtered by date 
range, feedback type, or text match. Feedback can also be exported to a CSV file.

- **Feedback Details**: Clicking on a row in the feedback table opens the Feedback Details page. This page 
displays the full feedback text and links to the conversation the feedback is associated with.
