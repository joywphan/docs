Event Triggers are used to trigger Maven App execution in response to a system event.

Most customers will add Event Triggers to their Agent by installing existing Maven Apps via the
App Marketplace. For advanced use cases, Event Triggers can also be created using the Maven API.

## Event Trigger Types

Currently, Maven supports these event trigger types:

- **Feedback Created**: The Event Trigger is triggered whenever feedback is created or updated.
- **Conversation Created**: The Event Trigger is triggered whenever a conversation is created or updated.
