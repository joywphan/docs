Actions are used to trigger Maven App execution to respond to a user question. 
The LLM chooses which Action to execute based on the question and the current state 
of the conversation.

Most customers will add Actions to their Agent by installing existing Maven Apps via the 
App Marketplace. For advanced use cases, Actions can also be created using the Maven API.

## Action States

Actions can be in one of three states:

- **Pinned**: The Action will always be provided to the LLM.
- **Included**: The Action will be provided to the the LLM if it is relevant to the user question.
- **Excluded**: The Action is disabled and will not be provided to the LLM.

## Tuning Actions

When a customer asks a question, Maven will find relevant Actions and provide them to the LLM. 

These relevant Actions include all Actions which are Pinned as well as any actions whose description 
field is similar to the user question. The original description field is provided by the Maven App
which created the Action. However, this field can be overridden on the Action Details page if the 
description does not match your business logic needs.

## Navigation

- **Actions**: The Actions page displays all Actions created by the user. 
Actions can be bulk selected to change their state.

- **Action Details**: Clicking on a row in the Actions table opens the Action Details page. This page 
displays the full Action text and allows editing of the Action description.
