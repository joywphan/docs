The Agent Settings page allows you to configure branding and personalization for your Maven agent.

## Branding

The brand color and logos are currently used to customize chat, search and instant answers.

## Response Customization

Response customization allows you to change how Maven responds to customer questions. You can:
- [Change the personality](https://docs.mavenagi.com/personas) of your Maven agent
- Specify additional instructions to tune responses with brand specific tone
- Provide up to 3 popular questions shown on the chat and search pages
- And specify a bailout message to return to customers when Maven is unable to answer a question

## Handoff

There are currently two types of handoff available. 
- Text handoff allows you to specify a message to display to customers when Maven is unable to answer 
  a question.
- Integration handoff allows you to specify a ticketing system to route Maven's responses to. 
  Currently, Maven supports Salesforce, Zendesk, and Freshdesk.
  
## Conversation Processing

When syncing tickets from Salesforce, Zendesk, or Freshdesk you can specify certain ticket tags that Maven 
should ignore.

If Maven receives a ticket with a tag that matches one of the ignored tags, that ticket will not receive
suggestions nor show up in insights. You can see the tags that are currently in use for your Agent on 
the insights page.
