Maven offers widgets that allow you to embed a Maven experience directly into your website. Currently, 
there is a chat experience and an instant answers experience.

To add either widget to your website, you need to add a small piece of javascript to your page. 
This javascript code will initialize the widget and connect it to your Maven instance.

Your personalized code snippet can be found on either the chat settings page or instant answers settings 
page within the Dashboard. You'll need to copy and paste the code snippet into your website's HTML to get started. 
More specific instructions for common sites are provided below.

## Chat Widget

The chat widget currently supports one additional setting - the welcome message. This message will be
shown to the user when they first open the chat widget. 

The chat widget's background color and logo at the top of the widget are configured on the Agent Settings page.
They match the Brand Color and the Horizontal logo, respectively.

## Instant Answers Widget

The instant answers code snippet requires a slightly deeper integration than the chat widget.
It needs to know which piece of the page to attach the widget to and also needs to know when the user question 
has been submitted and what the question was. This requires a bit more HTML knowledge.

## Setting up Zendesk help center

Zendesk provides [instructions](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408839332250-Customizing-your-help-center-theme#topic_gxl_3qw_n3)
for customizing your help center theme. Follow those instructions to edit your theme.

For the chat widget you want to add your code snippet to script.js.

For the instant answers widget:

1. Goto “search_results.hbs”
2. Find
    ```
          {{#if results}}
            <ul class="search-results-list">
    ``` 
   And replace with:
    ```
          <div id="maven-instant-answer-container" style="margin-bottom: 5px"></div>
          {{#if results}}
            <ul class="search-results-list">
    ```
3. Add the following to the end of the file and remember to replace the API KEY with your Maven API key 
found within the code snippet on the Instant Answers Settings page.
```
<script src="https://www.mavenwidgets.net/widget.js" async></script>
<script>
// load the widget
addEventListener("load", function () {
  Maven.InstantAnswerWidget.init({
    apiKey: "REPLACE THIS WITH API KEY"
  });
  if (document.getElementById('query') !== null) {
    Maven.InstantAnswerWidget.search({
      query: document.getElementById('query').value,
      selector: '#maven-instant-answer-container'
    });
  }
}); 
</script>
```
