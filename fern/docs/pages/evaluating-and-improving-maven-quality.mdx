## How to think about Maven quality

Maven is designed to answer questions with expert human quality. 
A high quality answer should be:

1. Factually correct, complete, and helpful
2. Empathetic, personalized, and with a human touch
3. Timely

## There are three drivers to Maven quality

1. **Knowledge** that is uploaded to Maven to enable it to retrieve facts used to answer questions
3. **User context** that enables Maven to personalize answers to be relevant to the user
3. **Personality** and writing styles that match your brand voice and writing style

## Understanding quality

To compute the quality of a response, Maven uses a combination of signals including

1. **Automatic self grading:** Maven has a self-grading mechanism that displays how 
confident it is based on how much relevant information it has in knowledge.
2. **Automatic grading against human responses:** Maven automatically grading historic 
tickets against human responses where human agent responses are available
3. **Human feedback** from Copilot and end-user thumbs up and down
